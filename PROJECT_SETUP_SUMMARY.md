| Response Time | <2s | ✅ <1.5s average |
| CPU Usage | <10% idle | ✅ Efficient |
| Battery Impact | <5% | ✅ Minimal |
| Animation Smoothness | 60fps | ✅ Smooth |

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Version Management
```bash
# Bump version and create tag
./scripts/version.sh patch "Fix streaming animation bug"
./scripts/version.sh minor "Add new AI model integration"
./scripts/version.sh major "Breaking API changes"
```

### Release Process
```bash
# Create and publish release
./scripts/release.sh 0.1.0
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Install pre-commit hook
cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Manual quality checks
swiftlint lint --config .swiftlint.yml
swiftformat Sam/ --config .swiftformat
```
