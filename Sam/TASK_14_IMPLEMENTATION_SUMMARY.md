- Brightness operations: `brightnessUp`, `brightnessDown`, `brightnessSet`
- Display operations: `displaySleep`, `systemSleep`
- Network operations: `wifiToggle`, `bluetoothToggle`, `doNotDisturbToggle`, `nightShiftToggle`
- Maintenance operations: `cacheClear`, `diskCleanup`, `emptyTrash`
- Power operations: `restartSystem`, `shutdownSystem`

### SystemControlResult
Result structure for all system control operations:
- Operation type and success status
- Human-readable result messages
- Previous and new values for value-changing operations
- Timestamp for operation tracking

### MaintenanceInfo
Comprehensive system maintenance analysis:
- Cache, trash, log, and temp file size tracking
- Total cleanable space calculations
- Recommended maintenance actions
- Space savings estimates

### NetworkConfiguration
Network status and configuration information:
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth status
- VPN connection monitoring
- DNS server configuration
- Proxy settings (placeholder for future implementation)

### DisplayInfo & AudioDevice
Hardware information structures:
- Display brightness and resolution information
- Audio device volume and configuration
- Device identification and capabilities

## Implementation Details

### AppleScript Integration
- Volume control through system volume commands
- Brightness control via System Events
- Network toggles through system preferences
- Trash management through Finder integration
- System power control through System Events

### Safety Features
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Destructive operations require user confirmation
- **Value Validation**: Input values are automatically clamped to valid ranges
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Permission Checks**: Graceful handling of permission-related failures
