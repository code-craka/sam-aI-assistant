## Key Methods Implemented

### Core Workflow Creation
```swift
func buildWorkflowFromDescription(_ description: String, name: String? = nil) async throws -> WorkflowDefinition
func buildAdvancedWorkflowFromDescription(_ description: String, context: WorkflowContext? = nil) async throws -> WorkflowDefinition
func buildWorkflowFromTemplate(_ template: WorkflowTemplate, parameters: [String: Any]) async throws -> WorkflowDefinition
```

### Validation and Optimization
```swift
func validateWorkflow(_ workflow: WorkflowDefinition) async throws -> WorkflowValidationResult
func optimizeWorkflow(_ workflow: WorkflowDefinition) async throws -> WorkflowDefinition
```

### Template Management
```swift
func generateWorkflowTemplate(from workflow: WorkflowDefinition, templateName: String? = nil) -> WorkflowTemplate
func exportWorkflowTemplate(_ template: WorkflowTemplate) throws -> Data
func importWorkflowTemplate(from data: Data) throws -> WorkflowTemplate

## Usage Examples

### Creating Workflow from Description
```swift
let builder = WorkflowBuilder()
let workflow = try await builder.buildWorkflowFromDescription(
    "Every morning, organize my Downloads folder, open Mail and Calendar, and create a daily notes file"
)
```

### Using Built-in Templates
```swift
let backupTemplate = WorkflowBuilder.getTemplates(for: .backup).first!
let workflow = try await builder.buildWorkflowFromTemplate(
    backupTemplate, 
    parameters: [
        "project_path": "/Users/me/MyProject",
        "backup_destination": "/Volumes/Backup"
    ]
)
```

### Template Search and Discovery
```swift
let organizationTemplates = WorkflowBuilder.searchTemplates("organize")
let allTemplates = WorkflowBuilder.getAllBuiltInTemplates()
```
