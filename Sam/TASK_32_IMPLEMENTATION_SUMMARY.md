    let name = "Weather Information"
    let supportedCommands = ["weather", "forecast"]
    
    func execute(_ command: String, context: PluginContext) async throws -> PluginResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Registering a Command Extension
```swift
let customCommand = CustomFileExtension()
CommandExtensionManager.shared.registerExtension(customCommand)
```

### Connecting to External API
```swift
let credentials = APICredentials(type: .apiKey, values: ["key": "your-api-key"])
let connection = try await ExternalAPIFramework.shared.connectToAPI("slack", credentials: credentials)
```

### Tracking Custom Events
```swift
TelemetryManager.shared.track("custom_feature_used", properties: [
    "feature": "advanced_search",
    "user_type": "power_user"
])
```

## Conclusion

The extensibility framework provides a robust foundation for Sam's future growth and customization. It enables:

1. **Third-party developers** to create plugins that extend Sam's capabilities
2. **Power users** to create custom commands and workflows
3. **External services** to integrate seamlessly with Sam
4. **Product teams** to make data-driven decisions through comprehensive analytics

The framework is designed with security, performance, and user privacy as core principles, ensuring that extensions enhance rather than compromise the Sam experience. The comprehensive test suite and documentation provide a solid foundation for ongoing development and maintenance.

This implementation successfully fulfills all requirements for Task 32 and establishes Sam as an extensible platform for AI-assisted productivity on macOS.
