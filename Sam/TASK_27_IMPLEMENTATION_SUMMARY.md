## Security Architecture

### Data Flow Security
```
User Input → Privacy Classification → Processing Decision
     ↓                                        ↓
Sensitive Data → Local Processing → Encrypted Storage
     ↓                                        ↓
Public Data → Cloud Processing (with consent) → Standard Storage
```

### Encryption Layers
1. **Transport Layer**: HTTPS/TLS for all network communications
2. **Application Layer**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data encryption
3. **System Layer**: macOS Keychain Services for credential storage
4. **Storage Layer**: Core Data with encrypted sensitive fields

### Permission Model
- **Required Permissions**: File System, Accessibility, Automation
- **Optional Permissions**: Contacts, Calendar, Photos, etc.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Functionality adapts to available permissions
- **User Control**: Clear explanations and easy permission management

## Privacy Features

### Data Sensitivity Classification
- **Public**: Weather queries, general questions → Cloud processing allowed
