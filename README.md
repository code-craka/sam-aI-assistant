## Overview

Sam is a native macOS AI assistant that represents a new paradigm of human-computer interaction. Unlike traditional AI assistants that only provide instructions, Sam actually performs tasks through deep system integration and natural language commands.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Task Execution**: Actually performs tasks vs. instruction-giving
- **üîí Privacy-First**: Local processing with minimal cloud dependencies  
- **üçé Native Integration**: Deep macOS system and app integration
- **üß† Contextual Intelligence**: Learns and adapts to user workflows
- **üí¨ Real-time Streaming**: Character-by-character response streaming
- **‚úèÔ∏è Message Management**: Edit and delete messages with full history
- **üé® Modern UI**: Native SwiftUI interface with accessibility support

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayemrihan/sam-macos-ai-assistant.git
cd sam-macos-ai-assistant
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open Sam/Sam.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project (‚åòR)

"Close all Chrome windows"
"Switch to Finder"
```

### Automation
```
"Create a workflow to backup my photos"
"Set up a daily reminder at 9 AM"
"Automate my morning routine"
```

## Architecture

Sam is built with a modern, privacy-first architecture:

- **Frontend**: Native SwiftUI with MVVM pattern
- **AI Processing**: Hybrid local/cloud processing
- **Data Storage**: Core Data with encryption
- **System Integration**: Native macOS APIs and AppleScript
- **Performance**: <200MB memory baseline, <2s response time

## Development

### Project Structure

```
Sam/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/           # Data models and Core Data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/            # SwiftUI views and UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Managers/         # Business logic and state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/         # External integrations and system APIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utils/            # Helper functions and extensions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/        # Assets and configurations
```

### Building from Source

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install SwiftLint for code quality
brew install swiftlint

# Install SwiftFormat for consistent formatting
brew install swiftformat
```

2. Run code quality checks:
```bash
swiftlint lint --config .swiftlint.yml
swiftformat Sources/ --config .swiftformat
```

3. Build and test:
```bash
xcodebuild -project Sam.xcodeproj -scheme Sam -configuration Debug build
xcodebuild test -project Sam.xcodeproj -scheme Sam -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

## Privacy & Security

Sam is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Processing**: 80%+ of tasks processed locally
- **Minimal Cloud Data**: Only complex queries sent to external services
- **No Training Data**: Your data is never used for AI model training
- **Encryption**: Local data encrypted at rest
- **Transparency**: Full control over data sharing preferences
