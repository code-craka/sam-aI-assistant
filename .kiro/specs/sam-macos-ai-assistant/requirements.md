# Requirements Document - Sam macOS AI Assistant

## Introduction

Sam is a native macOS AI assistant that combines natural language processing with task execution capabilities. Unlike traditional chatbots that only provide instructions, Sam actually performs tasks on the user's Mac through natural language commands. The assistant focuses on file operations, system management, app integration, and workflow automation while maintaining user privacy through a hybrid local/cloud processing approach.

The project aims to deliver 80% of the functionality of advanced AI assistants like MacPaw's Eney using AI-assisted development techniques, achieving a functional MVP in 16 weeks with a budget under $25K.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a Mac user, I want a native chat interface where I can communicate with Sam using natural language, so that I can interact with my computer more intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches Sam THEN the system SHALL display a native macOS chat interface with SwiftUI
2. WHEN the user types a message and presses Enter THEN the system SHALL process the input and display both user message and Sam's response
3. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history persistently using Core Data
4. WHEN the system is in dark mode THEN the interface SHALL automatically adapt to dark theme styling
5. IF the user has accessibility features enabled THEN the interface SHALL support VoiceOver and keyboard navigation
6. WHEN the user closes and reopens the app THEN the system SHALL restore the previous conversation history

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Task Classification

**User Story:** As a user, I want Sam to understand different types of requests from my natural language input, so that it can route tasks to the appropriate processing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user inputs a file operation command like "copy file.txt to Desktop" THEN the system SHALL classify it as FILE_OPERATION with >80% confidence
2. WHEN the user asks system queries like "what's my battery percentage" THEN the system SHALL classify it as SYSTEM_QUERY
3. WHEN the user requests app control like "open Safari" THEN the system SHALL classify it as APP_CONTROL
4. WHEN the user asks for text processing like "summarize this document" THEN the system SHALL classify it as TEXT_PROCESSING
5. IF the classification confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL route the request to cloud AI for processing
6. WHEN classification is complete THEN the system SHALL extract relevant parameters (file paths, app names, etc.) from the input

### Requirement 3: File System Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want Sam to perform file operations through natural language commands, so that I can manage my files without using Finder or terminal commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says "copy [file] to [destination]" THEN the system SHALL execute the file copy operation safely
2. WHEN the user requests "find all PDFs in Downloads" THEN the system SHALL search and return matching files with metadata
3. WHEN the user asks to "organize Desktop by file type" THEN the system SHALL create appropriate folders and move files accordingly
4. WHEN performing destructive operations THEN the system SHALL request user confirmation before proceeding
5. IF a file operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN batch operations are requested THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
7. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of actions taken

### Requirement 4: System Information Queries

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask Sam about my Mac's system status, so that I can quickly get information without opening system preferences or activity monitor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user asks "what's my battery percentage" THEN the system SHALL return current battery level and charging status
2. WHEN the user requests storage information THEN the system SHALL display available disk space and usage breakdown
3. WHEN the user asks about memory usage THEN the system SHALL show RAM usage statistics
4. WHEN the user inquires about network status THEN the system SHALL report connection status and active networks
5. IF system information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN displaying system info THEN the system SHALL format data in human-readable format

### Requirement 5: Application Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want Sam to control and interact with other Mac applications, so that I can perform tasks across multiple apps without manual switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says "open [app name]" THEN the system SHALL launch the specified application
2. WHEN the user requests "send email to [contact] about [subject]" THEN the system SHALL compose an email in Mail.app
3. WHEN the user asks to "create calendar event for [time]" THEN the system SHALL add the event to Calendar.app
4. WHEN the user wants to "bookmark this page in Safari" THEN the system SHALL add current page to Safari bookmarks
5. IF an app is not installed THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN app integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or manual instructions

### Requirement 6: AI Processing and Response Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want Sam to provide intelligent responses and handle complex queries, so that I can get help with tasks beyond simple system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user asks complex questions THEN the system SHALL route to OpenAI API for processing
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL stream output for real-time feedback
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track usage and costs
4. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to local processing
5. WHEN processing text content THEN the system SHALL handle summarization, translation, and formatting locally when possible
6. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context for follow-up questions

### Requirement 7: Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure Sam's behavior and manage my API keys, so that I can customize the assistant to my preferences and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display configuration options in a native macOS interface
2. WHEN the user enters API keys THEN the system SHALL store them securely using Keychain Services
3. WHEN the user modifies preferences THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without restart
4. WHEN the user sets task confirmation preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those settings for dangerous operations
5. IF settings are corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to safe defaults and notify the user
6. WHEN exporting settings THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information like API keys

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want Sam to handle my data securely and transparently, so that I can trust the assistant with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing simple tasks THEN the system SHALL use local processing without sending data to external services
2. WHEN cloud processing is required THEN the system SHALL inform the user and request permission
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information using system keychain
4. WHEN handling files THEN the system SHALL never upload file contents without explicit user consent

6. WHEN the user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all stored information

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want Sam to respond quickly and reliably, so that it enhances rather than hinders my productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL begin responding within 2 seconds for 90% of requests
2. WHEN performing local tasks THEN the system SHALL complete operations in under 5 seconds
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL recover gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds 200MB THEN the system SHALL optimize and clean up resources

3. WHEN workflow steps fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors according to user-defined preferences (retry, skip, abort)
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed summary of all actions taken
5. IF workflows require user input THEN the system SHALL pause and prompt for necessary information
6. WHEN saving workflows THEN the system SHALL allow users to name and reuse them for future execution
