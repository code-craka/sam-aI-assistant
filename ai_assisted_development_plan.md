            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
}

// Task Processing Engine
class TaskProcessor: ObservableObject {
    private let aiService = AIService()
    private let systemService = SystemService()
    
    func processTask(_ input: String) async -> TaskResult {
        // AI-generated task classification
